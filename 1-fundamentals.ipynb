    "# Sessions 1 & 2｜Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object** refers to real-world entities like a Car, Bike, Dog, etc.  \n",
    "An object has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Properties (variables)\n",
    "* Behaviors (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* It hides the internal implementation and exposes only the essential functionality to the user.\n",
    "* It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "    * Cellphone: Making a call is abstracted. Users press a button, not concerned with how the call connects.\n",
    "    * Car: Pressing the brake slows the car, but the internal workings of the braking system are hidden from the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increases security and confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation bundles the data and the code working on that data into a single unit, also known as **data hiding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Achieving Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declare a variable in a class as private.\n",
    "* Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loosely coupled code.\n",
    "* Better access control and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance is the capability of a class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class.\n",
    "* It allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, so we do not have to write the same code again.\n",
    "* It can be achieved using the `extends` keyword or through an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Inheritance\n",
    "    * A child class derives properties and behaviors from a single parent class.\n",
    "* Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "    * A class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "* Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "    * One superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "* Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "    * When a class extends more than one superclass, it's known as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "    * It is not supported directly in Java.\n",
    "    * Instead, it utilizes interfaces as a mechanism to achieve similar behavior and to overcome the [diamond problem](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/java/diamond-problem-in-java/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code reusability.\n",
    "* Allows achieving polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
    "* The same method behaves differently in different situations.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    * A person can be a father, husband, employee, and brother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compile-Time Polymorphism/Static Polymorphism/Method Overloading\n",
    "    * Methods with the same name and return type but different parameter lists.\n",
    "* Run-Time Polymorphism/Dynamic Polymorphism/Method Overriding\n",
    "    * A method in a child class overrides the implementation (body) of a method in its parent class.\n",
    "* Operator overloading is not supported in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is-a Relationship\n",
    "    * Achieved through inheritance.\n",
    "    * Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between parent and child classes.\n",
    "    * Example: \n",
    "        * A `DOG` is an `ANIMAL`.\n",
    "* Has-a Relationship\n",
    "    * When an object is used within another class.\n",
    "    * These relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "    * Examples:\n",
    "        * A `School` has `Students`.\n",
    "        * A `Bike` has an `Engine`.\n",
    "    * Association: A general relationship between two distinct objects.\n",
    "        * **Aggregation**: Both objects can exist independently. The lifecycle of one object does not depend on the other.\n",
    "            * A `Library` can exist without the `Books`, and the `Books` can exist outside of the `Library`.\n",
    "        * **Composition**: The existence of one object depends on the other. The end of one object will end the other object. \n",
    "            * If a `House` is destroyed, its `Rooms` are also destroyed because they cannot exist independently."

    "}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Private:** The access level of a private modifier is restricted to within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "* **Default:** The access level of a default modifier is limited to within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If no access level is specified, the default modifier is used.\n",
    "* **Protected:** The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through the child class. If no child class is created, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.\n",
    "* **Public:** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package, and outside the package.\n",

    "## Return Type\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a method does not return anything, use `void` as the return type.\n",
    "* You can use the class name or a primitive data type as the return type of the method.\n",

    "* Parameters are a list of variables used in the method.\n",
    "* The parameter list can be empty as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Body\n",

    "* **User-Defined Methods:** Methods created by the programmer based on the program's requirements.\n",
    "* **Overloaded Methods:** More than one method with the same name but different parameter lists can be created in the same class. Overloaded methods are differentiated based on arguments, not return type.\n",
    "* **Overridden Methods:** A subclass has the same method (name and return type) as the parent class, but the method body is different.\n",
    "* **Static Methods:**\n",
    "  * These methods are associated with the class.\n",
    "  * They can be called using just the class name.\n",
    "  * Static methods cannot access non-static instance variables and methods.\n",
    "  * Static methods cannot be overridden. `@Override` is for dynamic binding, whereas `static` is for compile-time polymorphism.\n",
    "  * When to declare a method as Static:\n",
    "      * Methods that do not modify the state of the object can be declared as static.\n",
    "      * Utility methods that do not use instance variables and compute values based only on arguments.\n",

    "## Frequently asked interview question on Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why constructors do not have a return type? \n",
    "  * Constructors do not have a return type because their primary purpose is to initialize an object, not to return a value.\n",
    "* Why constructors cannot be final?\n",
    "  * A `final` method cannot be overridden. If a constructor were `final`, it would prevent any subclass from modifying the constructor, which defeats the purpose of subclassing and initialization.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be abstract?\n",
    "  * An abstract method is a method that is declared but not implemented. An abstract constructor would imply that its implementation is provided by subclasses, which is not meaningful because constructors are used to create and initialize objects.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be static?\n",
    "  * A static method can only access static variables and methods, and cannot access instance variables. Since constructors are used to initialize instance variables, they cannot be `static`.\n",
    "* Can we define a constructor in an interface?\n",
    "  * No, we cannot define a constructor in an interface because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "* Why constructor name is same as of class name?\n",
    "  * This naming convention helps easily identify and distinguish constructors from other methods in the class.\n",

    "  * Weak reference\n",
    "    * A reference that allows the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references.\n",
    "    * `WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());` \n",

    "  * Serial Garbage Collector\n",
    "    * Uses a single thread for cleanup, causing program pauses during GC.\n",

    "    * Uses multiple threads for cleanup, reducing program pause time.\n",
    "  * CMS (Concurrent Mark & Sweep)\n",
    "    * GC threads work concurrently with application threads to reduce pause times.\n",
    "  * G1 (Garbage-First)\n",
    "    * Advanced GC designed to minimize pause times while maintaining throughput. \n",
    "* Heap memory is shared among all threads.\n",
    "* Heap also contains the String Pool.\n",
    "* If the heap memory is full, it throws a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`.\n",
    "* Heap memory is further divided into:\n",
    "  * Young Generation (minor garbage collection occurs)\n",
    "    * Eden\n",
    "      * Newly created objects are initially placed here.\n",

    "* MetaSpace\n",
    "  * Introduced in Java 8 to store class metadata.\n",
    "  * Grows automatically as needed, using native memory rather than heap space."
